        id: 1, question: "Do press-ons damage your nails?", answer: "With proper application and removal, press-ons won't cause damage to your nails.",
    },
    {
        id: 2, question: "My press-ons keep falling off, what should I do?", answer: "Be sure that nails are clean and dry before application. For optimal adhesion, gently buff your natural nails with the file included in your kit and wipe off the surface of your nails with the prep pad. Any oils on nails can prevent the glue from sticking.",
    },
    {
        id: 3, question: "How do I remove glue from my fingers?", answer: "To safely remove nail glue from your skin, start by soaking your fingers in warm, soapy water. If that doesn't do the trick, soak a cotton swab in acetone and rub it onto the areas where glue got onto your skin. Follow up with hand cream to reduce the chance of irritation.",
    },
    {
        id: 4, question: "How do I pick the right size press-ones for my nails?", answer: "Try laying your press-ons out on a table and fitting each one to your nail bed before gluing or sticking them onto your natural nails. The press-on should align with your cuticle and fit snuggly against both sides of your nail bed.",
    },
    {
        id: 5, question: "Can I file or cute press-ons?", answer: "Some light filing is absolutely fine, but avoid cutting your press-ons to keep their design and durability fully intact.",
    },
    {
        id: 6, question: "How do you remove press-ons?", answer: "First and foremost, never pull off your press-ons. Instead, follow the instructions below:Step 1: Soak Soak nails in warm water for at least 10 minutes. Add a few drops of cuticle oil to the water to help loosen adhesion. Step 2: Lift Once your press-ons start detaching from your nails, take them out of the water and use the cuticle stick to gently lift the press-ons away from your nails. Step 3: Soak Again If you glued on your press-ons, soak your nails for another 10 minutes, applying acetone under the press-ons to help remove them cleanly.",
    },
    {
        id: 7, question: "I can't remove some of my nails. What should I do?", answer: "If continuing the soaking process isn't working, drop some acetone into any tiny gaps between your natural nail and the press-on. Then, try gently lifting the press-on with the cuticle stick.",
